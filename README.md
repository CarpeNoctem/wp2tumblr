WP 2 Tumblr
===========

Another plugin to send WordPress posts to a Tumblr blog. Uses the Tumblr API (v2). 
Seems to be the most recent working plugin for this task. (The two older ones I found and tried don't work.)

TODO:  
* Add "Settings" link to plugins page entry
* Add help and [tumblr_register_application.png](https://raw.github.com/CarpeNoctem/wp2tumblr/master/includes/tumblr_register_application.png) to settings page
* Possibly more that I'm forgetting..
